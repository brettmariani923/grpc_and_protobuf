Your .proto file becomes the contract for a remote API.
From that contract, .NET automatically generates:


1. Strongly-typed C# client classes

These allow your C# code to call your AI servicelike a normal method.

    var client = new TextGeneration.TextGenerationClient(channel);

    var reply = await client.GenerateTextAsync(new TextRequest
    {
        Prompt = "Hello world"
    });

No HTTP routes.
No JSON.
Just pure RPC calls.


2. Strongly-typed C# server base classes

The .proto file generated a service base class you override:

    public class TextGenerationService : TextGeneration.TextGenerationBase
    {
        public override Task<TextReply> GenerateText(TextRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
        {
            return Task.FromResult(new TextReply
            {
                Text = "Generated text for: " + request.Prompt
            });
        }
    }

You write only the logic — the protobuf layer, serialization, and transport are already done.


3. Auto-serialization using Protobuf

Your messages (e.g., TextRequest, TextReply) are:

    -binary serialized (super fast)

    -strongly typed

    -validated at compile time

No JSON performance penalty.


4. Built-in full duplex streaming (if used)

If your .proto defines streaming:

    rpc StreamText (TextRequest) returns (stream TextReply);

You can stream tokens as they generate — exactly how ChatGPT works internally.


5. Ability to connect any language

Since it’s real gRPC any language can act as a client:

    -Python

    -Java

    -Go

    -Node.js

    -Rust

    -C++

    -Swift

All can talk to your .NET service using the same .proto contract.


6. Generated classes appear in:

    /obj/Debug/net8.0/generated/
        ai.proto
        text_generationGrpc.cs
        text_generation.cs

You don't check these into Git. They are regenerated on every build.


Its basically a full AI microservice architecture

Your gRPC service can:

    -receive prompts

    -generate text

    -stream output

    -scale independently

    -communicate with other services

This is the exact pattern real AI systems use (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc. all expose protobuf/gRPC schemas internally).
